TimeCert
========

This service timestamps sha1 digests as a trusted third party.

While GitHub provides timestamps as well. Together with TimeCert it provides two levels of independent impartial evidence of the existence of a commit. Which could be useful in IP protection both for OSS and private code.

To see the time stamp do:

http://timecert.org/{Hex Encoded SHA1}

For an example see:
